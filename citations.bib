abstract = {A semiempirical interatomic potential for Fe was used to calculate the diffusivity in bcc Fe assuming the vacancy and interstitial mechanisms of self-diffusion. Point-defect concentrations and diffusivities were obtained directly from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was found that self-diffusion in bcc Fe is controlled by the vacancy mechanism at all temperatures. This result is due to the fact that the equilibrium vacancy concentration is always much larger than the equilibrium interstitial concentration. The predominance of the equilibrium vacancy concentration over the interstitial concentration is explained by the lower vacancy-formation energy at low temperatures and high vacancy-formation entropy at high temperatures. The calculated diffusivity is in good agreement with experimental data. The MD simulations were also used to test the quasiharmonic (QH) approximation for point-defect calculations. It was found that the QH approximation can considerably underestimate variations in point-defect characteristics with temperature.},

@article{Mendelev2007,
abstract = {We report improved results of atomistic modeling of V-Fe alloys. We introduced an electronic structure embedding approach to improve the description of the point defects in first-principles calculations, by including the semicore electrons in some V atoms (those near the interstitial where the semicore levels are broadened) but not those further from the point defect. This enables us to combine good accuracy for the defect within large supercells and to expand the data set of first-principles point defect calculations in vanadium with and without small amounts of iron. Based on these data, previous first-principles work, and new calculations on the alloy liquid, we fitted an interatomic potential for the V-Fe system which describes the important configurations likely to arise when such alloys are exposed to radiation. This potential is in a form suitable for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large systems. Using the potential, we have calculated the migration barriers of vacancies in the presence of iron, showing that these are broadly similar. On the other hand, MD simulations show that V self-diffusion at high temperatures and Fe diffusion are greatly enhanced by the presence of interstitials. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

Using density functional theory calculations of fcc Al as an illustrative case, we determine the energetic and entropic contributions to vacancy formation and atomic migration. These results yield a quantitative description of the migration energy and vibrational prefactor via transition state theory. The calculated diffusion parameters and coefficients show remarkably good agreement with experiments. We provide a simple physical picture for the positive entropic contributions.},
