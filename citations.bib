abstract = {In recent years, the machine learning techniques have shown great potent1ial in various problems from a multitude of disciplines, including materials design and drug discovery. The high computational speed on the one hand and the accuracy comparable to that of density functional theory on another hand make machine learning algorithms efficient for high-throughput screening through chemical and configurational space. However, the machine learning algorithms available in the literature require large training datasets to reach the chemical accuracy and also show large errors for the so-called outliers - the out-of-sample molecules, not well-represented in the training set. In the present paper, we propose a new machine learning algorithm for predicting molecular properties that addresses these two issues: it is based on a local model of interatomic interactions providing high accuracy when trained on relatively small training sets and an active learning algorithm of optimally choosing the training set that significantly reduces the errors for the outliers. We compare our model to the other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature on the widely used benchmark tests.},

The potential is fitted to thermodynamic and point-defect properties obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments. The developed potential is also benchmarked against other potentials available in literature. It shows particularly good agreement with the DFT obtained mixing enthalpy of the random alloy, the formation energy of intermetallics and experimental excess vibrational entropy and phase diagram. In addition, DFT calculated point-defect properties, both interstitial and substitutional, are well reproduced, as is the screw dislocation core structure. As a first validation of the potential, we study the precipitation hardening of Fe-Cr alloys via static simulations of the interaction between Cr precipitates and screw dislocations. It is concluded that the description of the dislocation core modification near a precipitate might have a significant influence on the interaction mechanisms observed in dynamic simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {We investigate the application of embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic potentials in the study of crystallization kinetics from deeply undercooled melts, focusing on the fcc metals Al and Cu. For this application, it is important that the EAM potential accurately reproduces melting properties and liquid structure, in addition to the crystalline properties most commonly fit in its development. To test the accuracy of previously published EAM potentials and to guide the development of new potential in this work, first-principles calculations have been performed and new experimental measurements of the Al and Cu liquid structure factors have been undertaken by X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate that the previously published EAM potentials predict a liquid structure that is too strongly ordered relative to measured diffraction data. We develop new EAM potentials for Al and Cu to improve the agreement with the first-principles and measured liquid diffraction data. Furthermore, we calculate liquid-phase diffusivities and find that this quantity correlates well with the liquid structure. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of crystal nucleation from the melt during quenching at constant cooling rate. We find that EAM potentials, which predict the same zero-temperature crystal properties but different liquid structures, can lead to quite different crystallization kinetics. More interestingly, we find that two potentials predicting very similar equilibrium solid and liquid properties can still produce very different crystallization kinetics under far-from-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the rapid quenching simulations employed here.},

To investigate the properties of atomic defects that control this behaviour, a set of many-body interatomic potentials has been developed for the Fe-Cu system. The procedures employed, including modifications to ensure suitability for simulating atomic collisions at high energy, are described. The effect of copper on the lattice parameter of iron in the new model is in good agreement with experiment. The phonon properties of the pure crystals and, in particular, the influence of the instability of the metastable, bcc phase of copper that precipitates during irradiation are discussed. The properties of point defects have been investigated. It is found that the vacancy has lower formation and migration energy in bcc copper than in $\alpha$-iron, and the self-interstitial atom has very low formation energy in this phase of copper. The threshold displacement energy in iron has been computed as a function of recoil orientation for both iron-and copper-atom recoils. The differences between the energy for the two species are small. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {Different approaches are analyzed for construction of semi-empirical potentials for binary alloys, focusing specifically on the capability of these potentials to describe solid-liquid phase equilibria, as a pre-requisite to studies of solidification phenomena. Fitting ab initio compound data does not ensure correct reproduction of the dilute solid-solution formation energy, and explicit inclusion of this quantity in the potential development procedure does not guarantee that the potential will predict the correct solid-liquid phase diagram. Therefore, we conclude that fitting only to solid phase properties, as is done in most potential development procedures, generally is not sufficient to develop a semi-empirical potential suitable for the simulation of solidification. A method is proposed for the incorporation of data for liquid solution energies in the potential development procedure, and a new semi-empirical potential developed suitable for simulations of dilute alloys of Mg in Al. The potential correctly reproduces both zero-temperature solid properties and solidus and liquid lines on the Al-rich part of the Al-Mg phase diagram.},

abstract = {Recent molecular dynamics simulations of the growth of [Ni 0.8Fe0.2/Au] multilayers have revealed the formation of misfit-strain-reducing dislocation structures very similar to those observed experimentally. Here we report similar simulations showing the formation of edge dislocations near the interfaces of vapor-deposited (111) [NiFe/CoFe/Cu] multilayers. Unlike misfit dislocations that accommodate lattice mismatch, the dislocation structures observed here increase the mismatch strain energy. Stop-action observations of the dynamically evolving atomic structures indicate that during deposition on the (111) surface of a fcc lattice, adatoms may occupy either fcc sites or hcp sites. This results in the random formation of fcc and hcp domains, with dislocations at the domain boundaries. These dislocations enable atoms to undergo a shift from fcc to hcp sites, or vice versa. These shifts lead to missing atoms, and therefore a later deposited layer can have missing planes compared to a previously deposited layer. This dislocation formation mechanism can create tensile stress in fcc films. The probability that such dislocations are formed was found to quickly diminish under energetic deposition conditions.},

Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order (Formula presented) operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special “metric” and a special “preconditioning” optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced.

It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order (Formula presented) scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach (Formula presented).

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

For self-interstitials, direct MD simulation of the diffusion has yielded useful data. Vacancy and self-diffusion, however, proceeds at a much slower rate, so that a direct simulation is not always practicable, particularly in the reactor-operating temperature regime. In this paper, we follow an alternate route based on thermodynamic integration and calculate the enthalpy, entropy and attempt jump frequencies of vacancy migration and formation in $\alpha$-Zr for various temperatures ranging from 100 K to 1100 K. Their jump-direction and temperature dependencies are examined. The diffusivities so derived compare very well with other calculated results. Comparison with experimental self-diffusion data shows good general agreement except in the temperature regime near the $\alpha$-$\beta$ transformation. In this regime, the curvature in the Arrhenius plot of the self-diffusivity obtained is substantially smaller than the corresponding experimental results.

Our results show that the formation entropy of vacancies is not constant as often assumed but increases almost linearly with temperature. The resulting highly nonlinear temperature dependence in the Gibbs formation energy naturally explains the differences between positron annihilation spectroscopy and differential dilatometry data and shows that nonlinear thermal corrections are crucial to extrapolate high-temperature experimental data to T ¼ 0 K. Employing these corrections-rather than the linear Arrhenius extrapolation that is commonly assumed in analyzing experimental data-revised formation enthalpies are obtained that differ up to 20{\%} from the previously accepted ones. Using the revised experimental formation enthalpies, we show that a large part of the discrepancies between DFT-GGA and unrevised experimental vacancy formation energies disappears. The substantial shift between previously accepted and the newly revised T ¼ 0 K formation enthalpies also has severe consequences in benchmarking ab initio methods against experiments, e.g., in deriving corrections that go beyond commonly used LDA and GGA exchange-correlation functionals such as the AM05 functional.},

abstract = {We discuss technical aspects of the reversible vacancy-creation method for the computation of formation free energies as a function of temperature. The method is based on the introduction of a vacant lattice site into an otherwise perfect crystal by reversibly turning off the interactions between an atom and its surroundings, while allowing for full volumetric relaxations. By measuring the work associated with this process, the formation free energy can be computed directly using short nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The method is applied to determine the monovacancy formation free energy as a function of temperature for the Voter-Chen embedded-atom model for Ni, and is found to be significantly less demanding than the standard thermodynamic integration. The method is not restricted to single vacancies and is applicable to compute the formation free energies of point-defect clusters, surfaces, as well as chemical potentials associated with different atomic species in alloys.},

abstract = {Although the interpretation of experiments in such fields as the shapes of small particles and the thermal etching of surfaces usually involves problems of kinetics rather than mere equilibrium considerations, it is suggested that a knowledge of the relative free energies of different shapes or surface configurations may provide a useful perspective. This paper presents some theorems on these relative free energies which follow from the Wulff construction for the equilibrium shape of a small particle, and some relations between atomic models of crystal surfaces and the surface free energy function used in this construction. Equilibrium shapes of crystals and of noncrystalline anisotropic media are classified, and it is pointed out that the possibilities for crystals include smoothly rounded as well as sharp-cornered forms. The condition is formulated for thermodynamic stability of a flat crystal face with respect to formation of a hill-and-valley structure. A discussion is presented of the limitations on the applicability of the results imposed by the dependence of surface free energy on curvature; and it is concluded that these limitations are not likely to be serious for most real substances, though they are serious for certain idealized theoretical models.},

abstract = {A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.},

abstract = {To support and accelerate the development of simulation protocols in atomistic modelling, we introduce an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science called pyiron (http://pyiron.org). The pyiron IDE combines a web based source code editor, a job management system for build automation, and a hierarchical data management solution. The core components of the pyiron IDE are pyiron objects based on an abstract class, which links application structures such as atomistic structures, projects, jobs, simulation protocols and computing resources with persistent storage and an interactive user environment. The simulation protocols within the pyiron IDE are constructed using the Python programming language. To highlight key concepts of this tool as well as to demonstrate its ability to simplify the implementation and testing of simulation protocols we discuss two applications. In these examples we show how pyiron supports the whole life cycle of a typical simulation, seamlessly combines ab initio with empirical potential calculations, and how complex feedback loops can be implemented. While originally developed with focus on ab initio thermodynamics simulations, the concepts and implementation of pyiron are general thus allowing to employ it for a wide range of simulation topics.},

abstract = {Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local "bump" is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its presence.},

abstract = {An improved and simplified version of the finite temperature string (FTS) method [W. E, W. Ren, and E. Vanden-Eijnden, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6688 (2005)] is proposed. Like the original approach, the new method is a scheme to calculate the principal curves associated with the Boltzmann-Gibbs probability distribution of the system, i.e., the curves which are such that their intersection with the hyperplanes perpendicular to themselves coincides with the expected position of the system in these planes (where perpendicular is understood with respect to the appropriate metric). Unlike more standard paths such as the minimum energy path or the minimum free energy path, the location of the principal curve depends on global features of the energy or the free energy landscapes and thereby may remain appropriate in situations where the landscape is rough on the thermal energy scale and/or entropic effects related to the width of the reaction channels matter. Instead of using constrained sampling in hyperplanes as in the original FTS, the new method calculates the principal curve via sampling in the Voronoi tessellation whose generating points are the discretization points along this curve. As shown here, this modification results in greater algorithmic simplicity. As a by-product, it also gives the free energy associated with the Voronoi tessellation. The new method can be applied both in the original Cartesian space of the system or in a set of collective variables. We illustrate FTS on test-case examples and apply it to the study of conformational transitions of the nitrogen regulatory protein C receiver domain using an elastic network model and to the isomerization of solvated alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {Par "akdogan" - Publi{\'{e}} sur Amazon.com The book by Lupis is certainly not a book for the novice. In order to get the most out the book, a prior understanding of the principles of macroscopic thermodynamics is essential. Although the book covers the laws of thermodynamics in the first few chapters, it should be considered as an advanced and a very dense summary. What makes this is book so unique is the approach to problems in terms of open and closed systems. Such an approach is not the case in many other thermodynamics books such as the one by Gaskell, Darken {\&} Gurry, Swalin etc. I believe that Lupis' approach is very effective in forging the concept of chemical potential into the readers mind and as such, the pedagogical merits are to be recognized. Stability is discussed in a rather unorthodox manner and, a whole chapter is devoted to this concept. This is an example of the "philosophical depth" of the treatment. One aspect of the book that I enjoyed a lot when I was in graduate school is its comprehensiveness in the treatment. You will find pretty much everything from, say, solution thermodynamics to surface thermodynamics at a rather advanced level but in utmost clarity. Especially, the treatment of solution thermodynamics should not go unmentioned. Although, there are many books that treat solution thermodynamics in a very effective fashion such as "The Physical Chemistry of Metals and Alloys by Darken {\&} Gurry" as well as the book by Gaskel, Lupis' treatment is very original and exceptionally rigorous. The discussion of reference states and standard states is unique and is not found in other "good" books. Indeed those two concepts are used interchangeably in many texts which is not only misleading but also wrong! It should also be mentioned that the book is much more mathematical than other books in this field. Furthermore, the problem sets given at the end of each chapter are extremely well-chosen and by all means not elementary. The student who expects "plug {\&} go" type problems is bound to be duly and truly frustated. The only short coming of the book that I can think of is the order of the chapters. It somewhat deviates from the usual format but that should not cause any major problem with a little caution. The book can effectively be used in a graduate course in Chemical Thermodynamics of Materials. However, let me re-iterate that the reader must have mastered basic thermodynamics (undergraduate level) quite well.},

We introduced an electronic structure embedding approach to improve the description of the point defects in first-principles calculations, by including the semicore electrons in some V atoms (those near the interstitial where the semicore levels are broadened) but not those further from the point defect. This enables us to combine good accuracy for the defect within large supercells and to expand the data set of first-principles point defect calculations in vanadium with and without small amounts of iron. Based on these data, previous first-principles work, and new calculations on the alloy liquid, we fitted an interatomic potential for the V-Fe system which describes the important configurations likely to arise when such alloys are exposed to radiation. This potential is in a form suitable for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large systems. Using the potential, we have calculated the migration barriers of vacancies in the presence of iron, showing that these are broadly similar. On the other hand, MD simulations show that V self-diffusion at high temperatures and Fe diffusion are greatly enhanced by the presence of interstitials. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

Point-defect concentrations and diffusivities were obtained directly from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was found that self-diffusion in bcc Fe is controlled by the vacancy mechanism at all temperatures. This result is due to the fact that the equilibrium vacancy concentration is always much larger than the equilibrium interstitial concentration. The predominance of the equilibrium vacancy concentration over the interstitial concentration is explained by the lower vacancy-formation energy at low temperatures and high vacancy-formation entropy at high temperatures. The calculated diffusivity is in good agreement with experimental data. The MD simulations were also used to test the quasiharmonic (QH) approximation for point-defect calculations. It was found that the QH approximation can considerably underestimate variations in point-defect characteristics with temperature.},

@article{Weinan2005,
abstract = {A method is presented for the study of rare events such as conformational changes arising in activated processes whose reaction coordinate is not known beforehand and for which the assumptions of transition state theory are invalid. The method samples the energy landscape adaptively and determines the isoprobability surfaces for the transition: by definition the trajectories initiated anywhere on one of these surfaces has equal probability to reach first one metastable set rather than the other. Upon weighting these surfaces by the equilibrium probability distribution, one obtains an effective transition pathway, i.e., a tube in configuration space inside which conformational changes occur with high probability, and the associated rate. The method is first validated on a simple two-dimensional example; then it is applied to a model of solid-solid transformation of a condensed system.},

@article{Vineyard1957,
abstract = {The movement of defects in solids on the basis of classical absolute rate theory is reexamined with special attention to many-body aspects. The effective frequency in the Arrhenius expression governing these processes is shown to be, in harmonic approximation, the ratio of the product of the N normal frequencies of the entire crystal at the starting point of a transition to the product of the N-1 normal frequencies of the crystal when it is constrained in a saddle point configuration. The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver. {\textcopyright} 1957.},

@article{Eyring1935,
abstract = {The calculation of absolute reaction rates is formulated in terms of quantities which are available from the potential surfaces which can be constructed at the present time. The probability of the activated state is calculated using ordinary statistical mechanics. This probability multiplied by the rate of decomposition gives the specific rate of reaction. The occurrence of quantized vibrations in the activated complex, in degrees of freedom which are unquantized in the original molecules, leads to relative reaction rates for isotopes quite different from the rates predicted using simple kinetic theory. The necessary conditions for the general statistical treatment to reduce to the usual kinetic treatment are given.},
